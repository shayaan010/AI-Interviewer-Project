# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration Guide

This document provides information on how to use and extend the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in the PrepWise platform.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol developed by Microsoft that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). It enables AI applications to connect with various data sources and tools in a consistent manner, enhancing their capabilities and flexibility.

The MCP protocol follows a client-server architecture:
- **MCP Hosts**: Applications like AI assistants or integrated development environments (IDEs) that initiate connections.
- **MCP Clients**: Connectors within the host application that maintain 1:1 connections with servers.
- **MCP Servers**: Services that provide context and capabilities through the standardized MCP.

## PrepWise MCP Server

The PrepWise platform includes a custom MCP server implementation that enables advanced AI capabilities:

### Core Features

1. **Tool Registration**: Register new tools that can be used by AI models
2. **Request Handling**: Process requests from AI models to execute tools
3. **Model Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple AI models for complex tasks
4. **Context Management**: Maintain state and context during AI interactions

### Available Tools

The MCP server comes with several pre-registered tools:

| Tool Name | Description | Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `interview.getQuestions` | Get interview questions based on job role and difficulty | `role`, `difficulty` |
| `interview.analyzeResponse` | Analyze a candidate response and provide feedback | `question`, `response`, `role` |
| `models.orchestrate` | Orchestrate multiple AI models for a complex task | `task`, `models` |

## Using the MCP Service

The `MCPService` class provides a client-side interface for interacting with the MCP server:

```typescript
import { MCPService } from '@/lib/services/mcpService';

// Get interview questions
const questions = await MCPService.getInterviewQuestions('frontend', 'intermediate');

// Analyze a response
const analysis = await MCPService.analyzeResponse(
  'Tell me about your experience with React',
  'I have been using React for 3 years...',
  'frontend'
);

// Orchestrate multiple models
const result = await MCPService.orchestrateModels(
  'Generate and evaluate interview questions',
  ['gemini-pro', 'claude-3-sonnet']
);
```

## Extending the MCP Server

You can extend the MCP server by registering new tools:

### 1. Register a new tool

Add a new tool to the server in `backend/mcp/server.ts`:

```typescript
mcpServer.registerTool({
  name: 'interviews.simulate',
  description: 'Simulate an entire interview with a virtual interviewer',
  parameters: {
    role: { type: 'string', description: 'Job role' },
    company: { type: 'string', description: 'Target company' },
    experience: { type: 'string', enum: ['entry', 'mid', 'senior'], description: 'Experience level' }
  },
  handler: async (params) => {
    // Implement your tool logic here
    const { role, company, experience } = params as { role: string; company: string; experience: string };
    
    // Return the result
    return {
      // Your result data
    };
  }
});
```

### 2. Add a client-side method

Add a method to the `MCPService` class in `lib/services/mcpService.ts`:

```typescript
/**
 * Simulate an entire interview
 */
static async simulateInterview(
  role: string, 
  company: string, 
  experience: string
): Promise<SimulationResult> {
  return await this.invokeTool('interviews.simulate', { role, company, experience });
}
```

### 3. Use the new tool in your component

```typescript
const simulationResult = await MCPService.simulateInterview('frontend', 'Google', 'senior');
```

## MCP Demo Page

The PrepWise platform includes a demo page at `/mcp-demo` that showcases the capabilities of the MCP server. You can use this page to test the available tools and understand how they work.

## Future Enhancements

The MCP server is designed to be extensible and can be enhanced in various ways:

1. **Integration with more AI providers**: Add support for more AI models
2. **Additional specialized tools**: Create tools for specific interview scenarios
3. **Custom model fine-tuning**: Use the MCP to manage fine-tuned models
4. **Advanced state management**: Implement more sophisticated context tracking
